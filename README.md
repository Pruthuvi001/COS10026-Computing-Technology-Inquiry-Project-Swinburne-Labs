d) Minimum requirements to pass this unit
As the minimum requirements of assessment to pass a unit and meet all Unit Learning
Outcomes to a minimum standard, a student must achieve:
• achieve an overall mark for the unit of 50% or more.
e) Examinations
There is no examination for this unit in Semester 2 2023.
f) Submission Requirements
• Unless specified otherwise, assignments and other assessments are submitted online
through the Canvas assessment submission system which integrates with the Turnitin
plagiarism checking service. Please refer to the assignment specification for details.
• Please ensure you keep a copy of the submitted assessments.
g) Extensions and Late Submission
• Extensions will only be granted in exceptional circumstances on medical or compassionate
grounds. Extensions MUST be applied for in advance of the assignment's due date.
• Late Submissions - Unless an extension has been approved, late submissions will result in a
penalty. You will be penalised 10% of the assessment’s worth for each calendar day the task
is late, up to a maximum of 5 days. After 5 calendar days, a zero result will be recorded.
• Feedback or comments from the marker will generally not be available on assignments which
are submitted after five working days past the published deadline.
h) Referencing
To avoid plagiarism, you must provide a reference whenever you include information from
other sources in your work. Further details regarding plagiarism are available in Section
C of this document.
Referencing convention required for this unit is APA Style. Helpful information on referencing
can be found at http://www.swinburne.edu.au/library/referencing/.
i) Groupwork Guidelines
A group assignment is the collective responsibility of the entire group, and if one member is
temporarily unable to contribute, the group should be able to reallocate responsibilities to
keep to schedule. In the event of longer-term illness or other serious problems involving a
member of group, it is the responsibility of the other members to notify immediately the Unit
Convenor or relevant tutor.
Group submissions must be submitted with an Assignment Cover Sheet, signed by all
members of the group.
Unit Outline COS10011 Creating Web Applications Page 6 of 8
All group members must be satisfied that the work has been correctly submitted. Any
penalties for late submission will generally apply to all group members, not just the person
who submitted.
Students need to sign the team agreement and submit a peer review form for each
assignment.
Recent Unit Improvements
Due to changing industry practice and feedback from students, HTML is no longer required to be
strictly XML compliant.

PART C: FURTHER INFORMATION
Student behaviour and wellbeing
All students are expected to: act with integrity, honesty and fairness; be inclusive, ethical and respectful of
others; and appropriately use University resources, information, equipment and facilities. All students are
expected to contribute to creating a work and study environment that is safe and free from bullying,
violence, discrimination, sexual harassment, vilification and other forms of unacceptable behaviour.
The Student Charter describes what students can reasonably expect from Swinburne in order to enjoy a
quality learning experience. The Charter also sets out what is expected of students with regards to your
studies and the way you conduct yourself towards other people and property.
You are expected to familiarise yourself with University regulations and policies and are obliged to abide by
these, including the Student Academic Misconduct Regulations, Student General Misconduct Regulations
and the People, Culture and Integrity Policy. Any student found to be in breach of these may be subject to
disciplinary processes.
Examples of expected behaviours are:
• conducting yourself in teaching areas in a manner that is professional and not disruptive to others
• following specific safety procedures in Swinburne laboratories, such as wearing appropriate
footwear and safety equipment, not acting in a manner which is dangerous or disruptive (e.g.
playing computer games), and not bringing in food or drink
• following emergency and evacuation procedures and following instructions given by staff/wardens
in an emergency response
Canvas
You should regularly access the Swinburne learning management system, Canvas, which is available via
the Current Students webpage or https://swinburne.instructure.com/ Canvas is updated regularly with
important unit information and communications.
For further information on any of these topics, refer to Swinburne’s Current
Students web page http://www.swinburne.edu.au/student /.
Unit Outline COS10011 Creating Web Applications Page 7 of 8
Communication
All communication will be via your Swinburne email address. If you access your email through a provider
other than Swinburne, then it is your responsibility to ensure that your Swinburne email is redirected to your
private email address.
Academic Integrity
Academic integrity is about taking responsibility for your learning and submitting work that is honestly your
own. It means acknowledging the ideas, contributions and work of others; referencing your sources;
contributing fairly to group work; and completing tasks, tests and exams without cheating.
Swinburne University uses the Turnitin system, which helps to identify inadequate citations, poor
paraphrasing and unoriginal work in assignments that are submitted via Canvas. Your Unit Convenor will
provide further details. Only original works will be assessable for marking.
Plagiarising, cheating and seeking an unfair advantage with regards to an exam or assessment are all
breaches of academic integrity and treated as academic misconduct.
Plagiarism is submitting or presenting someone else’s work as though it is your own without full and
appropriate acknowledgement of their ideas and work. Examples include:
• using the whole or part of computer program written by another person as your own
• using the whole or part of somebody else’s written work in an essay or other assessable work,
including material from a book, journal, newspaper article, a website or database, a set of lecture
notes, current or past student’s work, or any other person’s work
• poorly paraphrasing somebody else’s work
• using a musical composition or audio, visual, graphic and photographic work created by another
• using realia created by another person, such as objects, artefacts, costumes, models
• submitting assessments that have been developed by another person or service (paid or unpaid),
often referred to as contract cheating
• presenting or submitting assignments or other work in conjunction with another person or group of
people when that work should be your own independent work. This is regardless of whether or not
it is with the knowledge or consent of the other person(s). Swinburne encourages students to talk
to staff, fellow students and other people who may be able to contribute to a student’s academic
work but where an independent assignment is required, the work must be the student’s own
• enabling others to plagiarise or cheat, including letting another student copy your work or by giving
access to a draft or completed assignment
The penalties for academic misconduct can be severe, ranging from a zero grade for an assessment task
through to expulsion from the unit and, in the extreme, exclusion from Swinburne.
Student support
Swinburne offers a range of services and resources to help you complete your studies successfully. Your
Unit Convenor or studentHQ can provide information about the study support and other services available
for Swinburne students.
Special consideration
If your studies have been adversely affected due to serious and unavoidable circumstances outside of your
control (e.g. severe illness or unavoidable obligation), you may be able to apply for special consideration
(SPC).
Applications for Special Consideration will be submitted via the SPC online tool normally no later than
5.00pm on the third working day after the submission/sitting date for the relevant assessment component.
Accessibility needs
Sometimes students with a disability, a mental health or medical condition or significant carer
responsibilities require reasonable adjustments to enable full access to and participation in education. Your
needs can be addressed by Swinburne's AccessAbility Services by negotiating and distributing an
'Education Access Plan'. The plan makes recommendations to University teaching and examination staff.
You must notify AccessAbility Services of your disability or condition within one week after the
commencement of your unit to allow the University to make reasonable adjustments.
Unit Outline COS10011 Creating Web Applications Page 8 of 8
Review of marks
An independent marker reviews all fail grades for major assessment tasks. In addition, a review of
assessment is undertaken if your final result is between 45 and 49 or within 2 marks of any grade
threshold.
If you are not satisfied with the result of an assessment, you can ask the Unit Convenor to review the result.
Your request must be made in writing within 10 working days of receiving the result. The Unit Convenor will
review your result to determine if your result is appropriate.
If you are dissatisfied with the outcomes of the review, you can lodge a formal complaint.
Feedback, complaints and suggestions
In the first instance, discuss any issues with your Unit Convenor. If you are dissatisfied with the outcome of
the discussion or would prefer not to deal with your Unit Convenor, then you can complete a feedback form.

procedures, you are advised to seek advice from an Independent Advocacy Officer at Swinburne Student
Life.
